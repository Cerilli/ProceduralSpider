# ProceduralSpider
My first attempt at trying to make a procedurally animated "spider" using blueprints. It was just a personal learning experience that I never intended to make worthy of sharing, so it's a mess of animator-brain logic. I'm sharing it as-is for anybody who came across my video and wants to take a look. Sorry for the mess!

Originally built in in Unreal 4.25. Also, I used the Electronic Nodes blueprint plugin and didn't bother trying to tidy up the bluebrints without it.

Feel free to do anything you want with this!
