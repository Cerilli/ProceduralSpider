# ProceduralSpider
My first attempt at trying to making a procedurally animated "spider" using blueprints. It's a mess of animator brain logic, and not done well at all, but I'm sharing it as-is for anybody who came across my video and wants to take a look. Sorry for the mess.

Originally built in in Unreal 4.25
